## Before you get started

Before you start contributing to the Pebble LSP consider having a look at the [best practices](#best_practices) and the [code style guide](#style_guide) adopted in the Pebble LSP project

<a name="best_practices"></a>

### Best Practices

- **Test your changes**: Always test the extension in the VS Code Extension Development Host
- **Use TypeScript**: All code should be written in TypeScript with proper type annotations
- **Follow LSP specifications**: When implementing LSP features, follow the [Language Server Protocol specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
- **Update syntax definitions**: When adding new Pebble language features, update the TextMate grammar accordingly
- **Documentation**: Update documentation when adding new features or changing existing behavior

<a name="style_guide"></a>

### Code Style Guide

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for TypeScript, 4 spaces for JSON)
- Follow existing naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes)
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Handle errors appropriately in the LSP server
